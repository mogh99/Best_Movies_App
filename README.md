#Best Movies App
Android app is written in the java programming language. The app uses [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to show three movie categories that are popular, top-rated and coming soon. 
The details of the movie are also shown a brief description, user rating, release date, and redirect the user for reviews, 
and trailers (youtube). For every movie, the app shows the recommendations, and similar movies so the user can navigate endlessly between movies. 
Moreover, the app allows users to save their favorite movies and see the detail of the favorite movies offline.


**Note: ** To use the app you need to have an API_KEY from [themvoiedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). And Insert the API_KEY 
in the code in NetworkUtil.java file. The app can be run and install to any android device with 21Sdk or greater using Android Studio.
